# Adaptive Matrix-Vector Multiplication with Hierarchical Nested Quantizers

## Overview

This module implements adaptive matrix-vector multiplication using hierarchical
nested lattice quantizers with column-wise encoding. The approach interprets
matrix-vector multiplication as a linear combination of column vectors, where each
column can have different target bit rates and some vector elements are known to
be zero a priori.

## Mathematical Framework

### Problem Formulation

Given:

-   Matrix A ∈ ℝ^(m×n)
-   Vector x ∈ ℝ^n (with known sparsity pattern)
-   Target bit rates R = [R₁, R₂, ..., Rₙ] for each column
-   Sparsity pattern S ⊆ {1, 2, ..., n} indicating non-zero elements of x

Goal: Compute y = Ax efficiently using hierarchical nested quantization with
adaptive bit allocation.

### Column-wise Interpretation

Matrix-vector multiplication can be expressed as:

```
y = Ax = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ xᵢ · A[:,i]
```

Where:

-   A[:,i] is the i-th column of matrix A
-   xᵢ is the i-th element of vector x
-   Only columns corresponding to non-zero xᵢ need to be processed

## Adaptive Quantization Strategy

### 1. Column-wise Encoding

Each column A[:,i] is encoded independently using hierarchical nested
quantization:

```
A[:,i] → (b₁⁽ⁱ⁾, b₂⁽ⁱ⁾, ..., b_M⁽ⁱ⁾, T⁽ⁱ⁾)
```

Where:

-   b_j⁽ⁱ⁾ are the encoding vectors for level j
-   T⁽ⁱ⁾ is the overload scaling factor
-   M is the number of hierarchical levels

### 2. Adaptive Bit Rate Allocation

The quantization parameters for each column are determined by the target bit
rate Rᵢ:

```
q⁽ⁱ⁾ = f(Rᵢ, M)  # Quantization parameter
β⁽ⁱ⁾ = g(Rᵢ, M)  # Scaling parameter
```

### 3. Sparse Vector Handling

For sparse vector x with known sparsity pattern S:

-   Only encode columns A[:,i] where i ∈ S
-   Skip computation for i ∉ S (xᵢ = 0)
-   Pre-compute lookup tables only for active columns

## Implementation Approach

### Core Components

#### 1. AdaptiveColumnQuantizer

```python
class AdaptiveColumnQuantizer:
    def __init__(self, target_rates, lattice_params):
        # Initialize quantizers for each column with different rates
        pass
    
    def encode_column(self, column, col_idx):
        # Encode single column with adaptive parameters
        pass
    
    def decode_column(self, encoding, col_idx):
        # Decode single column
        pass
```

#### 2. SparseMatVecProcessor

```python
class SparseMatVecProcessor:
    def __init__(self, matrix, sparsity_pattern, target_rates):
        # Pre-process matrix and setup quantizers
        pass
    
    def encode_matrix(self):
        # Encode all columns with adaptive rates
        pass
    
    def compute_matvec(self, sparse_vector):
        # Compute matrix-vector product using encoded columns
        pass
```

#### 3. AdaptiveLookupTable

```python
class AdaptiveLookupTable:
    def __init__(self, lattice_params, max_rate):
        # Pre-compute lookup tables for different rates
        pass
    
    def get_table(self, rate):
        # Retrieve appropriate lookup table for given rate
        pass
```

### Algorithm Flow

#### Phase 1: Preprocessing
